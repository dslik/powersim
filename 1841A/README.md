The panel controller boards are starting to come together. I have all of the LEDs and LCDs now responding:

Found some minor and easily fixed issues with the right-most buttons, but other than that, everything looks ready for a V1 release. All that remains is testing the serial I/O and that it can be successfully powered from a SEL-3610.

These are using the beautiful but unfortunately quite expensive Omron B3W-9000 buttons.
